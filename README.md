# ddm-ps
A powershell script for using the dell display manager to switch machines.  I use it with my U3415W; but it should work with any dell monitor that supports the display manager.

This is a simple powershell script for calling DDM on a 64bit windows machine for switching monitors.

You can follow the [installation instructions](http://toddwseattle.github.io/ddm-ps/) to use on your machine

For more information on ddm and to download it go [here](http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=9YJ4T)

Change the $monitor variable to the monitor you want to switch to.
